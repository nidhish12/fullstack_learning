        Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species.
        From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted green coffee. The
        seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them into a consumable product: roasted coffee, which is
        ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of
        coffee.

        Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its
        caffeine content.[3] It is one of the most popular drinks in the world[4] and can be prepared and presented in a
        variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). It is usually
        served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk or cream are often used to
        lessen the bitter taste or enhance the flavor. It may be served with coffee cake or another sweet dessert, like
        doughnuts. A commercial establishment that sells prepared coffee beverages is known as a coffee shop (not to be
        confused with Dutch coffeeshops selling cannabis).
        <br>
        The two most commonly grown coffee bean types are C. arabica and C. robusta. Coffee plants are cultivated in
        over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent,
        and Africa. As of 2018, Brazil was the leading grower of coffee beans, producing 35% of the world total.[6]
        Coffee is a major export commodity as the leading legal agricultural export for numerous countries.[7] It is one
        of the most valuable commodities exported by developing countries. Green, unroasted coffee is the most traded
        agricultural commodity and the most traded commodity overall, second only to petroleum.[8] Despite the sales of
        coffee reaching billions of dollars, those actually producing the beans are disproportionately living in
        poverty.[9] Critics also point to the coffee industry's negative impact on the environment and the clearing of
        land for coffee-growing and water use. The environmental costs and wage disparity of farmers are causing the
        market for fair trade and organic coffee to expand.
