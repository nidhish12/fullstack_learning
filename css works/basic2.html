    <h1>BITCOIN-CRYPTOCURRENCY</h1>
    <p>
        Bitcoin (₿) is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be
        sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.[8] Transactions
        are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a
        blockchain. The cryptocurrency was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name
        Satoshi Nakamoto.[10] The currency began use in 2009[11] when its implementation was released as open-source
        software.[7]: ch. 1 

        Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining. They can be exchanged for other currencies,
        products, and services,[12] but the real-world value of the coins is extremely volatile.[13] Research produced
        by the University of Cambridge estimated that in 2017, there were 2.9 to 5.8 million unique users using a
        cryptocurrency wallet, most of them using bitcoin.[14]

        Bitcoin has been criticized for its use in illegal transactions, the large amount of electricity (and thus
        carbon footprint) used by mining, price volatility, and thefts from exchanges. Some economists and commentators
        have characterized it as a speculative bubble at various times. Bitcoin has also been used as an investment,
        although several regulatory agencies have issued investor alerts about bitcoin.[13][15][16] In September 2021,
        El Salvador officially adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, becoming the first and only nation in the world to do
        so.
