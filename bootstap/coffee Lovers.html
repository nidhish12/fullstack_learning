            <h2>About Coffee</h2>
            <p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea
                species. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted
                green coffee. The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them into a consumable product:
                roasted coffee, which is ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being
                filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.

                Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due
                to its caffeine content.[3] It is one of the most popular drinks in the world[4] and can be prepared and
                presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caff√® latte, or already-brewed canned
                coffee). It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Sugar, sugar substitutes,
                milk or cream are often used to lessen the bitter taste or enhance the flavor. It may be served with
                coffee cake or another sweet dessert, like doughnuts.</p>
